General assets that we use. Some for testing, and some for eg, decoding the topology of the geometry.

* `face_topology.obj` Topology of the face meshes that we use. Does not include neck.
* `face_topologwy_with_shoulder.obj` Topology of the face with neck and shoulders. Would be better to use this for the release
* `021924.bin` is an example registered mesh used for tests
* `021924.png` is an example average texture used for tests
